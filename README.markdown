PinnedHeaderListView
================

This library provides a sectioned ListView with pinned headers. A custom adapter is provided which must be extended and used with the custom ListView.

The usage of this library is simple. You need to create an adapter that extends SectionedBaseAdapter.

There are 6 methods that need to be overridden:

* ```public Object getItem(int section, int position);```
* ```public long getItemId(int section, int position);```
* ```public int getSectionCount();```
* ```public int getCountForSection(int section);```
* ```public View getItemView(int section, int position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent);```
* ```public View getSectionHeaderView(int section, View convertView, ViewGroup parent);```

```getItemView``` and ```getSectionHeaderView``` should be treated as you would the ```getItemView``` method from a normal Adapter.
The same goes for ```getItem``` and ```getItemId```.

```getSectionCount``` and ```getCountForSection ```replace the ```getCount()``` method from a standard adapter.
You should return the number of sections in your list in ```getSectionCount``` and the number of items in a section in ```getCountForSection```.

In addition to these methods, there are a few others you may override:

* ```public int getItemViewType(int section, int position);```
* ```public int getItemViewTypeCount();```
* ```public int getSectionHeaderViewType(int section);```
* ```public int getSectionHeaderViewTypeCount();```

These replace the ```getViewTypeCount() and getItemViewType(int position)``` methods from a standard adapter

Note that you can return the same ItemViewType for a header and a non header and these will be cached seperately by the underlying ListView.  
That is, you will never get a header view passed in as the convertView in ```public View getItemView(int section, int position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent);```,
nor will you get an item view passed in as the convertView in ```public View getSectionHeaderView(int section, View convertView, ViewGroup parent);```

See the provided example for more details.
